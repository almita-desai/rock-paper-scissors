# Rock Paper Scissors Game  

A **console-based** Rock Paper Scissors game where the computer adapts its moves based on the player's past choices. *(No GUI)*  

## How It Works  

✅ Two modes:  
- **Easy Mode (E):** The computer has a **60% chance** of countering your last move; otherwise, it picks randomly.  
- **Hard Mode (H):** The computer has a **70% chance** of countering the move you have played most frequently; otherwise, it picks randomly.  

✅ Tracks your move history and adjusts the computer’s strategy accordingly.
